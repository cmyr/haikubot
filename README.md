========

[@haiku9000](http://twitter.com/haiku9000) is a little bot that combines tweets from the twitter stream into a haiku, and tweets the results, like this:

```
Guess no gym again  
Yeah, got some game from my dad  
Designer cat food

— (@)Dnycetns / (@)Scrplyr91 / (@)psychedelics
```
or:

```
I Lost My Stuff Now
This place is very quiet
My stomach growling.

— (@)VeeDot15 / (@)fancyeye / (@)ImHerFrancito
```


It is built on top of [poetryutils 2.0](https://github.com/cmyr/poetryutils2), which does all of the heavy lifting with rhyme finding and syllable counting etcetera.

also requires mike verdone's [python twitter tools](http://mike.verdone.ca/twitter/) for sending tweets.
